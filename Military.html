                <p class="ind p">
                    While in the Marines, I held the occupation <a class="linkReg" href="https://www.careersinthemilitary.com/service-career-detail/marine-corps/intelligence-specialists/intelligence-specialist" target="_blank">
                    Intelligence Specialist</a>. This job consisted of creating intelligence by collecting and analyzing data, then using that intel to produce products and conduct briefs 
                    to improve the situational awareness of everyone, from Privates to the Commanding Officer. I had the privilege of performing this job for most of my time in 2nd Battalion
                    4th Marines, an infantry Battalion out of Camp Pendleton, CA. I also had the opportunity to serve as <a class="linkReg" href="https://www.cool.osd.mil/usmc/enlisted/0291.htm" target="_blank">
                    Acting Intelligence Chief</a> for my last year in 1st Transportation Battalion, also located in Camp Pendleton, CA.

                <p class="ind p">
                    Throughout my time, I was exposed to and aided in the development of unique tactics to modernize my units and push towards a more capable and skilled force. Many of these 
                    experiences developed my appreciation for how an open mind can be the difference between success and failure.

                <p class="ind p">
                    I got to travel around the world, spending my time across the US, a rotation to Darwin, Australia, a deployment on a MEU out of Okinawa, Japan, and 
                    testing new logistics operations in Guam! Throughout this time I learned a lot about how to follow and lead with individuals of the highest caliber. I made many 
                    amazing friends who are still among the people I treasure most in life.

                <p class="ind">
                    As a targeting and collections assistant, I learned attention to detail and diligence in long hours of surveillance. Then I became a Company Level Intelligence Cell,
                    the sole person responsible for every intelligence need in an infantry company, where creativity and improvisation lead to success. And finally, an Intelligence Chief. 
                    Although I was not eligible to hold the official MOS, I exceeded the expectations given to me, leading intelligence sections at battalion, regiment, and division level,
                    being requested, by name, to perform in these unique roles and train enlisted and officers to perform intelligence operations at an exceptional level. For these 
                    achievements, I was presented multiple awards for performance as well as motivation and leadership.

                    I attribute my mindset and work-ethic to the military. I have spent the majority of my formative years surrounded by difficult decisions, adverse situations 
                    and meaningful challenges. But I was guided through these times by the example of incredible individuals and the instilled mindset of discipline and core values. 
                    It showed me what it truly means to be loyal and part of a team, two things that will serve you well no matter the circumstance. I came to feel like I was 
                    part of a big family, filled with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds, and all the stronger because of it. 
                </p>
                <p class="ind">
                    I learned a slew of skills from my job in the military too. First and foremost, a healthy appreciation for diligence and attention to detail. Creating intelligence products 
                    requires that one have an open mind, consider multiple perspectives, and understand the purpose of its creation. Without considering all these aspects, 
                    it is highly likely the result will fall short of the goal, and in doing so, endanger the lives of fellow Marines and the mission overall. One key aspect 
                    that required a lot of practice is communicating the result, combining an informational brief or map, with the refined predictions from days of research and 
                    cross-referencing data.

                <p class="ind">
                    The final overarching lesson, think critically and creatively. I had dozens of opportunities to implement experimental tactics and technologies that were amazing, 
                    each in their own right, but demonstrated that there is always room for improvement. The trick, discovering, through concerted efforts and experiments, where to change 
                    tactics or standard operating procedures to improve efficiency, effectiveness or both.
