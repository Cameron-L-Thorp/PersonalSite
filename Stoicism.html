                Stoicism in the modern day
            </h2>
            <p class="ind">
                Stoicism is a time-tested and universally applicable philosophy. Although there are many areas of philosophical study, Stoicism has had the 
                greatest and the most positive impact on my life. Authors like Ryan Holiday (pictured) are known as the modern-day Stoics, who aid in translating knowledge from the days 
                of the Roman empire into a format digestible by a modern pallet. Stoicism is a resurging mindset focused on mindfulness, growth and being grateful for what life offers you, 
                both good and bad.

            <p class="ind">
                In an era where life for the average human is better and more convenient than it has ever been, it is often difficult to respect and 
                value the blessings of new challenges and the lessons from mistakes. That is what Stoicism strives to teach, and all it asks for in return is effort and an open 
                mind. It is certainly not the only path to take on the road to betterment, but you may find that many aspects of Stoicism underly 
                any successful or worthwhile pursuit of self or societal improvement. I would enthusiastically encourage anyone, even those only mildly interested, to look into 
                Stoicism. You may end up with a new perspective!

                In my opinion, the most influential Stoic text to this day is <a class="linkReg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a> by Marcus Aurelius.

                Lessons from ancient times
            </h2>
            <p class="ind">
                In the past, Stoicism was a niche study. But anyone from ancient times associated with its practice is regarded as exemplary or honorable, if not both. 
                Some of the most renowned Stoics were individuals like Epictetus, a freed slave who overcame mistreatment and a difficult life and 
                created his own school to share his mindset with others. Others were members of the government like Seneca, who dedicated his life to preventing Emperor Nero from waging 
                war and executing indiscriminately. Also Cato, well known for his mindset of only speaking when something was worth saying. And most famously, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, a man 
                thrust upon the throne at a young age during a massive war, whose rule was plagued by backstabbing, deceit, and infidelity, yet still to this day is known as 
                the Philosopher King.

            <p class="ind">
                Though they lived in a different world, the Stoic's lessons are as timeless as their memory. Their works survive because of others' diligence. Many "original" 
                Stoic texts were discovered unpublished long after the author died, or were derived from notes taken in their lectures. They believed the purpose of humans is to be 
                selfless and helpful, and in that, one may find peace and productivity.
